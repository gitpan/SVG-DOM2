SVG DOM2 allows you to open, modify and save svg (scalar vector graphics) using xml and DOM Level 2
It is based upon XML::DOM2 using the extentions and hooks provided to generate element based objects
allowing fine control and descovery on an svg documents above and beond standard xml but using the
strengths of keeping the structure.

This is currently in Alpha, it does not support all svg elements and all options upon those elements
Eventualy it should prevent non valid svg from being created and allow for advanced filtering and modification.
